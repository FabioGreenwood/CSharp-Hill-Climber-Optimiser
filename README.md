## Intro

Old personal project (2018) to create a simple hill climber algorithm, complete with dashboard. Still tracking down the source code.

## Working the file

To work the file, download the folder and then run the .exe. You may need to install .NET and C# to work. I've included a screenshot of the app working.

See the powerpoint for info about what the app is doing, will likely give the powerpoint an update, looking a bit sorry. 

## Challenges

Most complex part of the project was calculating and testing the calculation of the normal vectors for a multi-dimensional plane, this was achieved using "dot products".

This also made me encounter for the first time the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value. A concept I hadn't encountered yet in 2018, good fun debugging that all the same.
